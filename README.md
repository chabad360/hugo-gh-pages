This Action builds your Hugo Site (using the latest Hugo Extended) and pushes it to Github Pages.

This action also contains support for several external Hugo Helpers:

| Name | Support |
| ---- | ------- |
| reStructuredText |️ ✔ |
| Pandoc | ✔ |
| Asciidoctor | ✔ |
| PostCSS | ✔ |
| Pygments | ✔ |

If your site requires the use of another external helper, submit an issue and I'll try to add it.
